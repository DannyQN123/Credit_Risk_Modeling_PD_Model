# Lending_Club_Credit_Risk_Modeling
## The purposes of this project is:  
1. To build a Credit Risk model that predicts the Probability of Default (PD) of a customer, or, the probability that the customer will not repay their debt.
2. Create a User Interrface, to let Users input **_Informations_** of a customer, and return the **_Probability of Default_** of this customer

**Probability of Default (PD)** is one of the concept mentioned in Basel 2, thus the next discussion will be about Basel 2 as relevant to our project.

## Basel 2 Review
**Basel 2** has 3 pillars, but **Pillar 1** is what relevant to our project.  
Pillar 1 talks about the Minimum Capital Requirement a bank must have, which deals with 3 types of risk
- Credit Risk - as relevant to our project
- Operational Risk
- Market Risk
